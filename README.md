# EEG-Siganls-for-Neurodegenrative-diseases-Detection : Streamlit Application
This project focuses on classifying EEG signals into three categories:  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) Cognitively Normal (CN)

Key Features
Participants:
AD Group: 36 subjects
FTD Group: 23 subjects
CN Group: 29 subjects


Preprocessing:
Band-pass filter: 0.5â€“45 Hz
Artifact removal with ICA and ASR
Eye and jaw artifacts rejected


Data:
EEG recordings: 19 channels, sampled at 500 Hz
Total duration: ~485 minutes (AD), ~276 minutes (FTD), ~402 minutes (CN)


Goals
Develop a classification model to differentiate between AD, FTD, and CN.
Use advanced techniques like LSTMs for temporal feature extraction.
